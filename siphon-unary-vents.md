# Siphon Unary Vents

**So, we all know that Pressure/Gas Pumps max out at 4500kpa-**

**But Unary Vents have no limit:**

Which means you can do stuff like easily harvest whatever heat you need + H20 and Trit from a single setup more easily than you can from the incierator:

The filters on each side are all on different layers, leaving layer 5 free so that all filters on pulling and pushing to the same pipenet. The floor in the H2O/Trit pit are all reinforced.

Or setup the SM to have a higher standard of safety. \[**You actually have to leave the vent directly underneath the SM off if you want to produce power**, but if anything starts going wrong, you can turn it on and it allows you to correct the issue with little to no threat of delam]:

Don't do this on an actual round unless you have tested it in a solo game. I needed a ton of HyperNob for this, would probably take quite a while to get this much \[Roughly 2k mols of Nob]

## Setup

Anyway, the setup is easy. Feed air into a 2x1 area with an injector/vent:

</div>

And turn the Vent to these settings in the room's Air Alarm

**You now have the ability to add gas to a pipenet infinitely.**

You can also use this mechanic to:

* Safeguard the Waste Loop
* Pull Gases from behind the Turbine
* Plasma Flood parts of the Station
